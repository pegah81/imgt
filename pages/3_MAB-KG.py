                Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are proteins made in the laboratory that act as natural antibodies.
                They bind specifically to certain targets in the body and stimulate the immune system. The mechanisms of action of mAbs range from detection and destruction of target cells,
                stimulation of immune-mediated cell toxicity, to modulation of the immune system. The mAbs can also carry drugs or radiation to efficiently deliver cell-killing agents to target cells. 
                In order to provide a unique and valuable resource concerning mAbs with therapeutic application, <strong>IMGT&reg;</strong> has developed IMGT/mAb-DB, a database that contains standardized descriptions about mAbs, 
                their targets, clinical indications, and other characteristics.

                From an immunogenetics data integration perspective, we built the first FAIR immunogenetics knowledge graph, <strong>IMGT Knowledge Graph (IMGT-KG)</strong> to bridge the gap between nucleotide and protein sequences of
                IMGTÂ® databases. In this same perspective, we built <strong>IMGT/MAB-KG</strong>, the IMGT-KG for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, using semantic web standards and technologies. 
                <strong>IMGT/MAB-KG</strong> is a specific part of IMGT-KG that represents, describes, and structures all knowledge of therapeutic mAbs.
                It is intrinsically connected to the IMGT-KG and reuses terms and relationships from
